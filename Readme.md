This project is meant to end up being a fully playable chess game fully made in Python. The game will support a 2 player mode and will have its own calculator for single player mode. You will also be able to input your own game, as well as save your games locally.

The purpose of this project is to exercise OOP and to learn OOP and pygame in Python.
